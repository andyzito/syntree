arrow handles should have attachment lines
pressing esc should deselect
- and, if you are deselected and then press an arrow key, you should start back on the last selected node
investigate weird delay when clicking triangle button
deleting with movement arrows is 100% busted

new version:
- force directed node graph
- toggle between rigid/bouncy (or slider, even?)
- ability to vertical lock (as in, each layer of nodes locked to sliding on a horizontal line)
- ability to autodistribute in different ways:
-- equalize angles
-- calculate overlap and adjust
-- performance is less horrid if you only have to do it at the end
- ability to draw "from the bottom up"
- fix keyboard shortcuts, allow configuration
- configure vertical distance
